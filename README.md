Hi, I'm Francesco! 👋

In collaboration with @Jesusf94 and @Manuu-ita our first Data Analysis project, developed during an intensive Data Analysis and Machine Learning bootcamp at Develhope.

Project Overview:
In this repository, you'll find a complete workflow for data exploration and predictive modeling.
Libraries used: Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization.
Analysis: Probability calculations and statistical insights.
Machine Learning: Implementation of a Logistic Regression model.
We worked on this project both independently and in collaboration, practicing version control and teamwork.
